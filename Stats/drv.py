# Discrete Random Variable 
# P(X=1) = 0.3, P(X=0) = 0.7
# Probability Mass Function: f(x) = P^x (1-P)^(1-x)
# This is a Bernoulli Distribution

# a. Find the mean (expected value) of X using the given pmf. This means that what do we get in the output, on the average.

# b. Find the variance of the random variable X using the given pmf.

# c. Now the engineer/scientist, starts measuring the output. He/she repeats the process 20 times. The outcomes are as follows:
# X = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0]

# c-1. Plot the histogram of data

# c-2. Normalize the histogram and plot it.

# c-3. Find the mean and variance of the collected samples. Find the probability of p(X=1) from the
# collected measurements (is this the same as the actual probability P?). Compare the results with the actual
# mean and variances. Are they different? Explain what you learned from this problem.

# c-4) Plot the data with the approximated pmf (look at the actual pmf and instead of P use the probability
# of p(X=1) you found from the data). Plot the approximated and the actual pmf.
